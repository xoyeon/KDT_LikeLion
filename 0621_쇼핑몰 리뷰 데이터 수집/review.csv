review
"  This was a great value compared to retail shops around town. Bundles locally were around $999, I saved a few hundred dollars and got a pro series PC instead of a consumer-grade.  Better quality all around. Love the versatility of the convertible micro tower and the monitor is clear and sharp - and really like the 1TB drive!"
"  Shopped around and found this bundle that more than met my requirements. Ordered and received in 3 days, set up was uncomplicated w Windows10 already installed and the 21"" monitor is the perfect size. The vendor was responsive and that was critical in deciding to make this purchase. Very happy with my new desktop."
  Have had 9 hp laptops over the years and never had any trouble setting them up.  This desktop had programming problems right from the start.  Hp was helpful in sending me a new flash drive but unfortunately it was orrupt also.  Then I spent $59.99 to have for their on the spot repair but that was also futile.  Had to return it to Amazon for a refund.  I.e. my 1 star rating.
  Great computer! Good for families and school work.
"  Seller did help to try get it going with no luck, and did help me return it..So it worked out OK."

  Great computer
  Terrible video quality - hard to understand set up instructions ! Not worth the price
