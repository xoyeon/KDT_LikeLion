      "My friend told me this is a great bonding book that builds healthy attachement. She reccomended it for my 4 year old. I am not sure if there are 2 version but this is definetly not for his age. It is a beautiful cute lovely book. Love the messages & cute pictures. The pages are really nice and sturdy. comfortable cover. BUT its dissapointing cuz it's a one liner per page and he doesnt want me to read this one. I believe this is the perfect book to start reading when baby is a few months and then maybe if you read it so many times then by 4 a child will still love it because it is familiar, there are many bonding moments/memories associated with the book. I wish they had a version for older kids. I didnt return it cuz its a good quality book and it was a very good price. and I am still hoping my son will start enjoying it because the message is so great and so important. I doubt it though. This is really a 5 star book but for me its a 2-3 stars cuz just doesnt work for me.\n",
